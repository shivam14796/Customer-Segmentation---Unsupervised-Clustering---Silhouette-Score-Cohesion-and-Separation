# Customer-Segmentation---Unsupervised-Clustering---Silhouette-Score-Cohesion-and-Separation
Problem Statement: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Clustering Background In the competitive world of business, understanding customer segments is crucial for tailoring marketing strategies, improving customer service, and enhancing product offerings. Customer segmentation involves dividing a company's customer base into distinct groups that share similar characteristics. By leveraging data-driven methods, businesses can identify these segments to better understand their customer needs and behaviors.

Objective The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using unsupervised clustering techniques. Specifically, the goal is to:

Identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior and demographics. Evaluate the quality of the clustering using the Silhouette Score, which measures the cohesion and separation of the clusters. Data Description The dataset for this analysis includes the following features for each customer:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer. Age: Age of the customer. Gender: Gender of the customer. Annual Income: Annual income of the customer in dollars. Spending Score: A score assigned by the company based on customer behavior and purchasing data. Product Categories: Information on the types of products purchased by the customer.
